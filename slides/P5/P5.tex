\begin{frame}{Structure of the presentation}
    \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Introduction and problem statement.} This section should
     explain what is the project about in general and why the given problem
     matters. The significance of the problem may be justified both in terms of
     its theoretical/scientific or societal/business relevance.
     \item \textbf{Research question.} What is the specific research question
     the paper tries to answer? It can be either formulated as a
     strict hypothesis or as an exploratory question.
     \item \textbf{Research methods.} This section should discuss, at a general
     level, what data was collected and how.     
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
    
\begin{frame}{Structure of the presentation}
    \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Analytic methods.} What analytic methods were applied to
     answer the research question? This may include some methods
     that we discussed in the class (i.e. sentiment analysis or some other
     natural language processing methods), but not necessarily.
     \item \textbf{Results.} What were the main results? You don't have to
     go too much into detail, i.e., report statistical test results. Explain
     what was tested which hypotheses were rejected and for which there was no proof to reject them.    
     \item \textbf{Conclusions.} Discuss the results within the broader context of
     the literature (you can either do it based on the paper or you can interpret
     the results based on your knowledge). What is the take-home message?

\begin{frame}{Things to remember}
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Half an hour is less time than you think. \alert{Make up to 20 slides}.
     \item Begin by explaining the structure of the presentation.
     \item \alert{Use as many pictures/schemes as possible}.
     \item Don't use fancy transitions unless there is a good reason for that.
     \item Use colors wisely.
     \item Don't put too much bibliography in the slides. Unless it is something crucial.
     \item Rehearse your presentation before you give it.

            \item \alert<1>{The smart-city discourse is presently in flux}, engaged
            in intensive boundary-work and evidently struggling to gain wider
            support on several fronts (Joss et al., 2019).
            \item The smart-city transitions often focus on creating the 
            narrative of \alert<2>{vaguely defined benefits of quick fixes to the
            existing issues} (Jir{\'o}n et al. 2021).
            \item \alert<3>{Threats resulting from the commodification and
            commercialisation of data by Big Tech}, which is further facilitated
            by smart-city technologies (Zuboff, 2019).
            \item The use of sensors and ICT tools in effort to "flatten the
            curve". The increase of smart city techologies implementation as a
            \alert<4>{response to the COVID-19 pandemic}.

        \framesubtitle{Motivation}
        \begin{block}{}
            We wanted to observe whether the \alert{COVID-19 pandemic changed}
            the narrative on the transition of European cities into smart cities
            and consequently \alert{accelerated the implementation of smart city
            technologies}. We expected that the intensity of the changes shifted
            the existing narrative towards threats that excessive data
            collection on citizens may pose.

   %%             \small And almost 40 governments worldwide have rolled out -- or are about to -- their own coronavirus apps for everything from informing people if they've been in contact with anyone infected with COVID-19 to ensuring those that already have it stay home. All of this should set off alarm bells. Big Tech has become a global punching bag because of fears that Silicon Valley has too much control over our daily lives. But in their legitimate efforts to keep people safe, officials across the European Union, United States, and elsewhere are quickly falling into the same trap -- creating a government surveillance network on the fly, with little oversight and almost no clarity about when it will be shut down.%

In these unprecedented times, there has been a monumental shift in personal liberties, and there is undoubtedly a trade-off to be had between privacy and the need to curtail the spread of the pandemic, but what measures are appropriate and will they have a long-lasting social effect?

               The emerging technologies can, for example, be abused by authoritarian regimes to set up a ubiquitous surveillance apparatus. Most prominently, China has been using cutting-edge AI to build up a high-tech surveillance system and a crackdown on political dissent, according to media reports ‚Äì and other countries around the world, including European nations such as Serbia, have struck deals with Chinese companies to introduce their own systems aimed at monitoring individuals.%

      \begin{enumerate}
         %% \item Mixed-methods approach allows for a more accurate evaluation of the sentiment than algorithm-based analysis.
         \item Topic Modeling algorithms (LDA) seem to be accurate enough for reviewing a large corpus of texts.
         \item Call for an open and inclusive public conversation about smart city development and surveillance implementations.
         \item Europe needs to step up its game to avoid marginalization or even takeover by global tech players in ''digital race''.
         \item Arguments around technology are centered around economical interest rather than citizens‚Äô rights and concerns.
